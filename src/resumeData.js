        I got assigned to the NTA cluster, a group working in multiple projects for Deutsche Bank Germany. All teams I have been involved had between five and eight members working across multiple locations in an international environment using Scrum methodology. \n
        In the first part of my career in the company I was involved in several projects. I was focusing on the front-end side, coding new React features and solving bugs. I was also supporting other members of the team, doing code reviews and suggesting new refactors to improve the quality of the code. \n
        In the second part of my career in the company I was promoted to Analyst and while also doing coding tasks I also got new tasks like more project architectural decisions, documentation and doing technical interviews.

        In the first project I was involved the team was composed of three members; two senior javascript developers and me. The project was an in-house automatization tool for building hybrid mobile applications. We were using Kanban with source control and all the code I did was reviewed by one of the senior developers. My main task was to code some secondary features mainly in the back-end side. \n
        My second project was in the insurance company Generali where I took over a mobile project where a new chat feature needed to be added. I reported directly to the client.

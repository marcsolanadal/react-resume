Javascript Enthusiast (?)

### GFT - Javascript/React Expert
### March 2017 - Present (2 years)

The company was in great need of React developers and I was hired as an expert even I only had six months 
of experience doing side projects. That ended up being really great for my professional growth since I
was given a lot of senior developer tasks.

I got assigned to the NTA cluster, a group working in multiple projects for Deutsche Bank Germany.
All the teams I have been involved into were teams between five and eight people working across multiple
locations in an international environment. In all the projects we used Scrum with different ceremonies
depending on the Scrum master.

In the first part of my career in the company I was involved in two projects: Brokerage and Robin.
I was focusing on the front-end side, coding new React features and solving bugs. 
I was also supporting other members of the team, doing code reviews and suggesting new refactors to improve the quality of the code. 
One of those was a migration from the old testing technology stack (mocha, chai and karma) to Jest and also coding the framework to
ease the development of integration tests.

In the second part of my career in the company I was promoted to Analyst and while also doing
coding tasks I also got new tasks like more project architectural decisions, documentation and 
doing technical interviews.

The technologies used in all project were: ES6, React, Redux, Jest, styled-components and other support libraries.


### July 2016 - February 2017 (8 months)

Time invested into sorting out what I wanted to do with my life. xD
 
Time traveling and doing personal projects, also investing time into learning more deeply web 
technologies that interested me like React.

### ATSistemas - Junior Javascript developer
### October 2015 - June 2016 (9 months)

In the first project I was involved the team was composed of three members; two senior javascript developers and me.
The project was an in-house automatization tool for building hybrid mobile applications.
We were using Kanban with source control and all the code I did was reviewed by one of the senior developers.
My main task was to code some secondary features mainly in the back-end side using Node, MySQL, Cordova and Jenkins.

My second project was in the assurance company Generali where I took over a mobile project where a new chat
feature needed to be added. I reported directly to the client. The application was build with Angular and Cordova.


### Micronax - Freelance Javascript developer

Worked as a freelance developer three months on-site and three month remotely - located in Spain.

My main task there was to develop the login system for the game using OAUTH2 for platforms like Google and Facebook.
